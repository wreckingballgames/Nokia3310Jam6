# Design Scratch Pad

- "Tells" that normal cells randomly show which imply they are impostors; true tells and false positive tells, player has to decide to start pre-emptively freezing cells or not
- Emphasize that impostor cells do not know which cells are impostors if those cells are not revealed.
- Maybe movement speed is generated in a range, with impostors weighing the range more towards the higher end; a "tell." Impostors get a speed boost when they reveal themselves (also random?)
